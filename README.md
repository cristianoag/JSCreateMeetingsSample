Sample app to create meetings in Teams using MS Graph

This is a sample single page app based on JavaScript to call the CreateOnlineMeeting graph API to create meetings on Teams.

It can be used a sample showing how to incorporate meeting creation in custom applications.

Reference on the API

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/application-post-onlinemeetings?view=graph-rest-1.0&tabs=http

You can use npx http-server -c -1 to spawn a http server locally and use the code.

Need to create an App in Azure AD and configure appropriate permissions to onlineMeetings.
